The "Shazam" UAV drone project ðŸ”Š

Identification and mapping of sounds captured from UAV drones flights. Detection of type and specificities UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). The project is based on a Deep Learning model associated with sound signatures from specifics trained models.

Protecting people - Securing the airspace

The project proposes apps (web, Android, IOS) allowing to scan a sound signature in real time when a flight drone is detected. 

The project is made by the community and for the community ðŸ¤–

Interest
Drones represent a direct or indirect threat (war, recognition, intrusion, cyberattacks, etc.). The project can provide a lot of capabilities like a flights drones cartography OSINT, realtime database, unknown drones, etc.

The project aims specific development taking up advanced and directed microphones allowing an extended sound capture. It is also possible to aggregate the model in different military sub-projects.

Features
- Sound detection and recognition of the type and model of drone and its specificities (threats models).
- Information collection in a community or private cartography dataset.
- Identification of trends and global repercussions of the findings up in real time.

Technical composition
- LinaDrone-App is the mobile and web application taking over the user interface.
- LinaDrone-API is our API to introduce new models trained from new sound signatures.
- LinaDrone-Analyzer is based on *data-processing* to analyze sound spectra.
- LinaDrone-Trainer is a neural network to train models to recognize sound spectra provided by the community.
-LinaCLEF is the model of LinaDrone.
